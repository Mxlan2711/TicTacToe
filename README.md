## ✖️⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

### 📌 Project Description

simple **CLI-based** Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. 
One version is for two players, and another version allows playing against a basic AI.

In **"TicTacToe2Player.cpp"**, two players take turns competing against each other — Player `X` and Player `O`.
The game validates inputs, detects winners or draws, and displays the current board after each move.

This project is ideal for C++ beginners to practice working with:
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Input and output
- Arrays
- Game logic
