## ‚úñÔ∏è‚≠ï Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

### üìå Project Description

simple **CLI-based** Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. 
There are two versions:  
1. **Two-Player Version** ‚Äì Players `X` and `O` take turns competing against each other.  
2. **Basic AI Version** ‚Äì Play against a simple computer opponent.  

In **TicTacToe2Player.cpp**, the two players alternate turns.  
The game validates inputs, detects winners or draws, and displays the current board after each move.  

**TicTacToe2PlayerMatchTracking.cpp** follows the same concept but plays **three rounds** to determine the overall winner.  

This project is ideal for C++ beginners to practice working with:
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Input and output
- Arrays
- Game logic
