## ‚úñÔ∏è‚≠ï Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

### üìå Project Description

simple **CLI-based** Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. 
Two versions are for two players, and another version allows playing against a basic AI.

In **"TicTacToe2Player.cpp"**, two players take turns competing against each other ‚Äî Player `X` and Player `O`.
The game validates inputs, detects winners or draws, and displays the current board after each move.

**"TicTacToe2PlayerMatchTracking.cpp"** follows the same concept but plays **three rounds** to determine the overall winner.  

This project is ideal for C++ beginners to practice working with:
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Input and output
- Arrays
- Game logic
